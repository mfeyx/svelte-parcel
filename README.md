# A Svelte template

This is a Svelte template using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [svelte-spa-router](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router) - inspired by [Hackathon Starter](https://hackathon-starter.walcony.com)

## Getting started

    https://github.com/mylastore/svelte-parcel.git
    cd svelte-parcel
    npm install && npm start

Now head over to your favourite browser and open up `localhost:1234` and you are ready to go.

## Build

To build the project run the following:

    npm run build

## Tests

_NOTE: Current open issue in jest-transform-svelte when adding preprocessor tests get stuck in an infinite loop (works in Wallaby though), [Current issue](https://github.com/rspieker/jest-transform-svelte/issues/12_)

I prefer running my tests using Wallaby, but if you prefer plain old command line, just type the following to run your tests:

    npm t

## Linting

You may just check for linting or auto fix using these two options

    npm run lint
    npm run lint:fix
